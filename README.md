#ML_FAT_data

Sample data for results generated in the paper titled "Data-driven fire modeling: Learning first arrival times and model parameters with neural networks"

## Description

This repository simulated data and trained neural networks for forward
and inverse problems addressing fire spread. The simulated data is
generated with the model published in the paper titled "A simple model
for wildland fire vortexâ€“sink interactions".
